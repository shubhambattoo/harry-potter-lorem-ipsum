  `The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green
robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought
was that this was not someone to cross.`,
  `"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.`,
  `"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."`,
  `She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have
fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit
with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to
the upper floors.`,
  `They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry
could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right
-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall
showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They
crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have
done, peering about nervously.`,
  `"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term
banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very
important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be
something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with
the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free
time in your house common room.`,
  `"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced
outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your
triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose
house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is
awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a
credit to whichever house becomes yours.`,
  `"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the
rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."`,
  `Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened
under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
flatten his hair.`,
  `"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall.
"Please wait quietly."`,
  `"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron.`,
  `"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he
was joking."`,
  `Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole
school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have
to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.
He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,
too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering
very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one
she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more
nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to
the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He
kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall
would come back and lead him to his doom.`,
  `"What the --?"`,
  `He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just
streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,
they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing
at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat
little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him
a second chance --"`,
  `A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.Nobody answered.`,
  `"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you
  know."`,
  `"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to
  start."`,
  `Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away
  through the opposite wall.`,
  `Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line
  behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out
  of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors
  into the Great Hall.`,
  `Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read
  about it in Hogwarts, A History."`,
  `Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed
  a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she
  put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and
  extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.`,
  `Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,
  that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was
  now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there
  was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened
  wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:`,
  `"So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll
  kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."`,
  `The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It
  bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.`,
  `"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to
  be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"`,
  `"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.`,
  `The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at
  the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving
  merrily at her.`,
  `The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws
  stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.`,
  `"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's
  imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they
  looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick
  now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.
  He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but
  because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.`,
  `"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.`,
  `There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a
  pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and
  then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"`,
  `As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little
  hissing fires all over the hall.`,
  `Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty
  of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness,
  yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....
  So where shall I put you?"`,
  `Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not
  Slytherin.`,
  `"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be
  great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you
  on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure
  -- better be GRYFFINDOR!"`,
  `Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off
  the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so
  relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed
  that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and
  shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got
  Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff
  he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,
  horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.`,
  `He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
  Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
  back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,
  sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd
  gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair
  was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the
  ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man
  from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple
  turban.`,
  `And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean,"
  a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
  "Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was
  pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
  second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"`,
  `Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next
  to him.`,
  `Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how
  hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.`,
  `"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin
  our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!
  Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!`,
  `"Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But
  he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"`,
  `Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with
  food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
  roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon
  and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,
  peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint
  humbugs.`,
  `"That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry
  cut up his steak,`,
  `"Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His
  whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on
  a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it
  properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly
  Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,
  "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house
  championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without
  winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody
  Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."`,
  `Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
  sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained
  with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to
  see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.`,
  `"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest.`,
  `"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.`,
  `When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food
  faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment
  later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you
  could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam
  doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "`,
  `"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell
  him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock
  for him."`,
  `"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the
  family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept
  trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he
  pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but
  nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for
  dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles
  when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let
  go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They
  were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you
  should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might
  not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased
  he bought me my toad."`,
  `On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about
  lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm
  particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something
  into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-";
  "You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of
  thing -- ").`,
  `Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
  Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor
  Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy
  black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.`,
  `It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's
  turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across
  the scar on Harry's forehead.`,
  `The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
  feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he
  didn't like Harry at all.`,
  `"He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy.`,
  `"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.`,
  `"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so
  nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want
  to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about
  the Dark Arts, Snape."`,
  `Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.`,
  `At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to
  his feet again. The hall fell silent.`,
  `"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
  have a few start-of-term notices to give you.`,
  `"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to
  all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember
  that as well."`,
  `Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
  twins.`,
  `"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all
  that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.`,
  `"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
  interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.`,
  `"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor
  on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
  die a very painful death."`,
  `"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he
  usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the
  forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he
  might have told us prefects, at least."`,
  `"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried
  Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become
  rather fixed.`,
  `Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
  fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose
  high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.`,
  `"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"
  And the school bellowed:`,
  `"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
  Teach us something please,
  Whether we be old and bald
  Or young with scabby knees,
  Our heads could do with filling
  With some interesting stuff,
  For now they're bare and full of air,
  Dead flies and bits of fluff,
  So teach us things worth knowing,
  Bring back what we've forgot,
  just do your best, we'll do the rest,
  And learn until our brains all rot.`,
  `Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the
  Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
  Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.`,
  `"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!
  And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"`,
  `The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,
  out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were
  like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He
  was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits
  along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice
  Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging
  tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their
  feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when
  they came to a sudden halt.`,
  `A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as
  Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.`,
  `"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised
  his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself"`,
  `A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.`,
  `"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"`,
  `There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide
  mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking
  sticks.`,
  `"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"`,
  `He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.`,
  `"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked
  Percy.`,
  `Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on
  Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as
  he passed.`,
  `"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again.
  "The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even
  listen to us prefects. Here we are."`,
  `At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a
  pink silk dress.`,
  `"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait
  swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled
  through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the
  Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.`,
  `Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
  boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were
  obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five
  four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had
  already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their
  pajamas and fell into bed.`,
  `" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
  "Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."`,
  `Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he
  fell asleep almost at once.`,
  `Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange
  dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to
  him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was
  his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
  got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened
  painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with
  it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh
  became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,
  sweating and shaking.`,
  `He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he
  didn't remember the dream at all.`,
  `Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
  day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look
  at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
  Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on
  finding his way to classes.`,
  `There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
  sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different
  on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to
  remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you
  asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors
  that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It
  was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed
  to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit
  each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.`,
  `The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of
  them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
  Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
  direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a
  trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would
  drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,
  pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab
  your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"`,
  `Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus
  Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their
  very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a
  door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds
  corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was
  sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening
  to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor
  Quirrell, who was passing.`,
